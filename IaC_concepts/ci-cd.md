# CI/CD

## Best Practices Notes

- establish a CI/CD pipeline as early as possible in the project's - lifecycle
- provide quick feedback to team
- each pipeline can be executed independently in parallel with other - pipelines
- scheduling resource-intensive pipelines during off-peak hours when - system activity is lower
- protect sensitive data by centralized secret management tools
- integrate with test-driven development(TDD) and behavior-driven - development(BDD)
- integrate security in CI/CD processes
- monitor metrics on the execution of CI/CD pipelines
